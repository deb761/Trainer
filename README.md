This application allows the user to define workouts with activities for varying time periods, and then tracks
the workout and gives notice to change activities.  For example:

1. Warmup walk for 5 minutes
2. Repeat 5 times:

  a. Jog 5 minutes

  b. Walk 2 minutes

3. Cooldown walk for 5 minutes

At each transition, the app will beep and vibrate.
